# MovieLens Recommendation System

## Introduction
Our goal is to recommend movies to users, a crucial task in the industry for upselling and other purposes. In this project, we focus on the MovieLens platform. To achieve this, we will implement a machine learning framework to develop a recommendation system. We will use the commonly employed technique of matrix factorization and demonstrate the results through a user collaborative learning framework.

We developed the recommendation system in `notebooks/1_modelling.ipynb`, and we will showcase the deployment process in `app.py`. The model weights can be found at `artifact/model/best_mfnet_param.pth`.
